### 🟥Program description🟥
We want to implement software for managing a photographic archive distributed across various locations.
The photographs are cataloged based on a catalog of possible subjects, each subject has one
own key. Photos have a size and state of conservation; for color photos, it is
I know the type of print (light or opaque). The photos can be found in archives, of which the person responsible is known,
the address, telephone number and opening hours. Photos can describe characters, places
or objects. The characters have a name and a gender; some have died. For political figures, yes
indicates the party to which one belongs and any government position held. For artists, it indicates the
their main activity (painting, sculpture, ...). When photos describe artistic works, the
name of the work of art, the artist who created it, the place where the work resides and the year of
realization. When photos describe places or objects, the name and description are known.
